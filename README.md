Time, time, and just time

# What is this even for?
Well, just telling the time in a fancier way. Some examples include:
- Showing the time on another screen instead of just looking at your taskbar
- Set the time on an analog clock because solemnly you don't know how to tell the time in analog
- ....Just for fun
